I have an increasing curiosity towards computers, electronics and science. I hold a MSc in Electronics and Computer Engineering and I classify myself as a passionate for technology and science.

My area of focus is Machine Learning and AI, where I have been developing and applying state of the art research for the past 4 years, ranging from Data Analysis, NLP and Computer Vision.

I am also very passionate for open source software, community driven solutions, traveling and life itself :)
